# üìß Email Delivery Testing Guide for Non-Gmail Addresses

## Overview

This guide will help you test email delivery to non-Gmail addresses (Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.) to ensure the verification emails are being sent correctly.

---

## üöÄ Quick Test (Recommended)

The fastest way to test email delivery:

### Step 1: Run Quick Test with Your Email

Replace `your-email@outlook.com` with your actual test email address:

```bash
# Test with Outlook
node scripts/test-email-quick.js your-email@outlook.com

# Test with Yahoo
node scripts/test-email-quick.js your-email@yahoo.com

# Test with Hotmail
node scripts/test-email-quick.js your-email@hotmail.com

# Test with any other email
node scripts/test-email-quick.js your-email@example.com
```

### Step 2: Check Your Email

1. Check your **inbox** for the test email
2. **Also check your SPAM/JUNK folder** (very important!)
3. The email should arrive within 1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Results

**If email arrives:**
‚úÖ Email delivery is working! The issue may have been fixed.

**If email doesn't arrive:**
‚ùå Continue with the troubleshooting steps below.

## üîß Comprehensive Test Suite

For a more thorough test covering signup and resend flows:

### Step 1: Edit Test Script

Open `scripts/test-email-non-gmail-delivery.js` and update the test email addresses:

```javascript
const TEST_EMAIL_ADDRESSES = {
  outlook: 'your-actual-email@outlook.com',   // REPLACE THIS
  hotmail: 'your-actual-email@hotmail.com',   // REPLACE THIS
  yahoo: 'your-actual-email@yahoo.com',       // REPLACE THIS
  gmail: 'your-actual-email@gmail.com',       // REPLACE THIS (for comparison)
};
```

### Step 2: Run Comprehensive Tests

```bash
node scripts/test-email-non-gmail-delivery.js
```

This will test:
1. Direct Resend API email sending
2. Signup flow with verification email
3. Resend verification functionality

### Step 3: Review Results

The script will show detailed results for each provider and test type.

## üîç Troubleshooting Email Delivery Issues

### Issue 1: Domain Not Verified

**Symptom:** Error message includes "domain" or "not verified"

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Check if `app.proliinkconnect.co.za` is verified
3. If not, add these DNS records to your domain:

```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: [Verification code from Resend]

Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all

Type: CNAME
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [DKIM value from Resend]
```

4. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
5. Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

### Issue 2: Invalid API Key

**Symptom:** "authentication" error

**Solution:**
1. Verify your API key in `.env` file:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_SDXQnpH5_EhXAJihxYgJRRgug7xjs6qcX
   ```
2. Check in Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/api-keys
3. Create a new API key if needed

### Issue 3: Emails Going to Spam

**Symptom:** Emails arrive in spam/junk folder

**Solution:**
1. Add SPF record:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   ```
2. Add DMARC record:
   ```
   v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@proliinkconnect.co.za
   ```
3. Configure DKIM in Resend dashboard
4. Ask recipients to mark email as "Not Spam"
5. Build sender reputation over time

### Issue 4: Rate Limiting

**Symptom:** "429 Too Many Requests" error

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
2. Check rate limits in Resend dashboard
3. Upgrade Resend plan if needed

### Issue 5: Specific Provider Blocking (Outlook/Yahoo)

**Symptom:** Emails work for some providers but not others

**Solutions for Outlook/Hotmail:**
1. Check Microsoft SNDS (Smart Network Data Services)
2. Ensure SPF and DKIM are configured
3. Monitor complaint rates in Resend
4. Contact Microsoft postmaster if blocked

**Solutions for Yahoo:**
1. Register with Yahoo Email Deliverability
2. Implement feedback loops
3. Maintain low complaint rates (<0.1%)
4. Use consistent sending patterns

### Issue 6: No Error But No Email

**Symptom:** API returns success but email doesn't arrive

**Solution:**
1. Check Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/emails
2. Look for the email by Message ID
3. Check delivery status and any bounce messages
4. Verify recipient email address is correct
5. Ask recipient to check all folders (inbox, spam, junk, promotions)

### Via Resend Dashboard:

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Find your email by:
   - Recipient address

   - Timestamp
3. Check delivery status:
   - ‚úÖ **Delivered** - Email successfully delivered
   - üì¨ **Queued** - Email is being processed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bounced** - Recipient address issue
   - üö´ **Blocked** - Spam filter blocked
   - ‚ùå **Failed** - Sending failed

### Via Resend API:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.resend.com/emails/{email_id}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_SDXQnpH5_EhXAJihxYgJRRgug7xjs6qcX'
```

# Service Selection and Booking Flow Test Coverage

## Overview
This document outlines the test coverage for the service selection and booking flow implementation.

## Test Scripts

### 1. Service Selection Tests (`test-service-selection.ts`)
Tests the service configuration and structure:

- **Service Configuration Structure**
  - ✓ Validates main categories
  - ✓ Validates service categories
  - ✓ Validates service data structure
  - ✓ Checks required fields
  - ✓ Verifies service features

- **Service Utilities**
  - ✓ Tests `getAllServices` function
  - ✓ Tests `groupServicesByCategory` function
  - ✓ Verifies category grouping

- **Service Data Validation**
  - ✓ Validates required fields
  - ✓ Checks business logic rules
  - ✓ Verifies data types

### 2. Booking Flow Tests (`test-booking-flow.ts`)
Tests the end-to-end booking process:

- **Service Selection Flow**
  - ✓ Main category selection
  - ✓ Service category selection
  - ✓ Specific service selection

- **Booking Form Data**
  - ✓ Form field validation
  - ✓ Date/time format validation
  - ✓ Address validation

- **API Integration**
  - ✓ Service API endpoint
  - ✓ Data structure validation
  - ✓ Error handling

## Service Categories

### Beauty & Wellness
1. Hair Services
   - Haircut & Trim
   - Blow Dry & Styling
2. Nails
   - Manicure

### Home Services
1. Residential Cleaning
   - Standard Home Cleaning
2. Plumbing (Database Services)
3. Electrical (Database Services)

## Test Coverage Matrix

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests |
|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Service Configuration | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Service Selection | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Booking Form | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| API Integration | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Areas for Future Testing

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with multiple concurrent bookings
   - Response time for service listing
   - Database query optimization

2. **Error Handling**
   - Network failure scenarios
   - Invalid data handling
   - Edge cases in service selection

3. **User Experience**
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Accessibility testing
   - Browser compatibility

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js and npm installed
   - TypeScript configured
   - Database connection

2. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run service selection tests
   npx ts-node scripts/test-service-selection.ts

   # Run booking flow tests
   npx ts-node scripts/test-booking-flow.ts
   ```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:
- Run on every pull request
- Run before deployment
- Automated test reports

## Known Limitations

1. **Time Zone Handling**
   - Tests assume South African time zone
   - May need adjustment for international use

2. **Database Dependencies**
   - Some tests require database connection
   - Mock data used where possible

## Recommendations

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Increase unit test coverage
   - Add visual regression tests

2. **Performance**
   - Add load testing scenarios
   - Monitor API response times
   - Test with larger datasets

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep test documentation updated
   - Document new test cases
   - Maintain test coverage reports

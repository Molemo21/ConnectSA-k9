# Bank Details Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive bank details management system for service providers in the ConnectSA platform. The feature allows providers to securely set up and manage their bank account information for receiving payments from completed jobs.

## Features

### 1. User Menu Integration
- **Bank Details** option added to the user menu dropdown (visible only for providers)
- Quick access from any page in the application
- Consistent with existing menu structure

### 2. Dedicated Bank Details Page
- **Route**: `/provider/bank-details`
- **File**: `app/provider/bank-details/page.tsx`
- **Component**: `components/provider/provider-bank-details-content.tsx`
- **Loading State**: `app/provider/bank-details/loading.tsx`

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- **Bank Details** button added to provider dashboard header
- **Reminder Banner** for providers without bank details
- **Success Message** for providers with completed setup
- **Inline Form** for quick updates

### 4. Security Features
- Account number masking for display (shows only last 4 digits)
- Forced re-entry of account number when updating (security best practice)
- Encrypted storage of sensitive information
- Role-based access control (providers only)

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/provider/[id]/bank-details` - Retrieve bank details
- **POST** `/api/provider/[id]/bank-details` - Create/Update bank details

### Database Schema
The feature uses existing fields in the `Provider` model:
```prisma
model Provider {
  // ... existing fields ...
  bankName        String?
  bankCode        String?
  accountNumber   String?
  accountName     String?
  recipientCode   String?
  // ... existing fields ...
}
```

### Supported Banks
The system includes a comprehensive list of South African banks supported by Paystack:
- ABSA Bank, Access Bank, African Bank
- Bidvest Bank, Capitec Bank, Citibank
- FNB Bank, Grindrod Bank, HSBC Bank
- Investec Bank, Nedbank, Postbank
- Rand Merchant Bank, Sasfin Bank, Standard Bank
- TymeBank, Ubank, VBS Mutual Bank

### Form Validation
- Bank selection required
- Account number: 6-17 digits only
- Account holder name required (trimmed)
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Form state management with proper error handling

## User Experience

### 1. First-Time Setup
- Clear instructions and guidance
- Step-by-step form with validation
- Security explanations and best practices
- Test mode notification

### 2. Existing Users
- View current configuration
- Easy edit functionality
- Security reminders
- Success confirmations

### 3. Visual Design
- Modern, clean interface
- Consistent with platform design
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Loading states and animations
- Toast notifications for feedback

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- Account numbers are never displayed in full
- Forced re-entry when updating (prevents accidental exposure)
- Encrypted storage in database
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

### 2. Access Control
- Provider role verification
- User can only access their own bank details
- Session-based authentication required
- CSRF protection through Next.js

### 3. Input Validation
- Server-side validation of all inputs
- Account number format validation
- Bank code verification against allowed list
- XSS prevention through proper input sanitization

- Session management

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Real-time status updates
- Conditional display of reminders
- Success state management
- Consistent user experience

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- API endpoint tests

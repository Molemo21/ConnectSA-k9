- `/api/book-service/discover-providers` - Finds available providers
- `/api/book-service/send-offer` - Sends job offers to providers

#### **⚠️ API Issues**
- **Service ID Mapping**: Services API has hardcoded ID mapping for invalid IDs
- **Inconsistent Prisma Usage**: Some APIs use `prisma` directly, others use `db` from db-utils
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error response formats
- **Validation**: Some endpoints have redundant validation logic

#### **Missing APIs**
- ❌ No API for fetching service details with pricing
- ❌ No API for validating addresses
- ❌ No API for checking provider availability in real-time

### **Database Alignment Issues**
- ✅ BookingStatus enum matches database
- ✅ PaymentStatus enum matches database  
- ✅ ProviderStatus enum matches database
- ⚠️ Service ID format validation is inconsistent
- ⚠️ Some hardcoded values (duration: 2, platform fee: 10%)

## **🗄️ 3. Database Model Validation**

### **Models Checked**
- ✅ **User**: Properly structured with role-based access
- ✅ **Service**: Has required fields (id, name, category, description)
- ✅ **Provider**: Includes availability and status fields
- ✅ **Booking**: Properly linked to client, provider, and service
- ✅ **Payment**: Correctly structured with Paystack integration

### **Enum Validation**
- ✅ **BookingStatus**: PENDING, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, etc.
- ✅ **PaymentStatus**: PENDING, ESCROW, RELEASED, COMPLETED, etc.
- ✅ **ProviderStatus**: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, SUSPENDED
- ✅ **UserRole**: CLIENT, PROVIDER, ADMIN

### **Field Alignment**
- ✅ All UI fields map to database columns
- ✅ Required fields are properly validated
- ✅ Optional fields are handled correctly
- ⚠️ Some computed fields (ratings, reviews) could be optimized

## **📱 4. Mobile-First Design Issues**

### **Current Problems**
1. **Form Layout**: Too wide, requires horizontal scrolling on small screens
2. **Input Sizing**: h-12 inputs are too large for mobile (should be h-10 max)
3. **Spacing**: Excessive padding and margins waste screen space
4. **Navigation**: No mobile-specific navigation patterns
5. **Touch Targets**: Some buttons may be too small for touch interaction

### **Required Improvements**
1. **Compact Form Design**: Reduce form width and optimize spacing
2. **Responsive Inputs**: Scale input sizes appropriately for mobile
3. **Mobile Navigation**: Add bottom navigation or floating action buttons
4. **Touch Optimization**: Ensure all interactive elements meet 44px minimum
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Better experience on larger screens

## **🖥️ 5. Desktop & Large Screen Issues**

### **Current Problems**
1. **Wasted Space**: Form doesn't utilize available screen real estate
2. **No Grid Layout**: Could benefit from multi-column layout on desktop
3. **Inconsistent Spacing**: Doesn't scale well across screen sizes
4. **Missing Features**: No desktop-specific enhancements

### **Required Improvements**
1. **Responsive Grid**: Multi-column layout for larger screens
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Additional features for desktop users
3. **Better Spacing**: Scale padding and margins appropriately
4. **Enhanced UX**: Desktop-specific interactions and layouts

## **🎨 6. Design System Consistency Issues**

### **Current Problems**
1. **Inconsistent Components**: Not using existing design system components
2. **Mixed Styling**: Some custom styles instead of design tokens
3. **Missing Components**: Not leveraging StatusBadge, PaymentStatusDisplay, etc.
4. **Color Inconsistency**: Not following established color system

### **Required Improvements**
1. **Component Reuse**: Use existing StatusBadge, Button variants, etc.
2. **Design Tokens**: Follow established spacing, typography, and color system

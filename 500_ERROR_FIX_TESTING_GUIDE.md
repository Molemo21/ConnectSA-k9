# üîß 500 Error Fix - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed**

### **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added detailed logging for catalogue item queries

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The 500 error was likely caused by:
1. **Catalogue Item Not Found**: The `catalogueItemId` doesn't exist in the database
2. **Provider Mismatch**: The catalogue item exists but doesn't belong to the selected provider
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Problems connecting to the database
4. **Feature Flag Issues**: Environment variables not properly set

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

# Payment Method Enum Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem
When trying to create a cash booking, you got this error:
```
Error converting field "paymentMethod" of expected non-nullable type "String", found incompatible value of "CASH".
```

## Root Cause
The database had a `PaymentMethod` enum type that only contained 'ONLINE' - the 'CASH' value was missing, causing Prisma to reject it.

## Solution Applied ✅

**Database Fixed:** The `PaymentMethod` enum now includes both values:
- ✅ ONLINE
- ✅ CASH

## What You Need to Do Now

The Prisma client needs to be regenerated to recognize the schema changes. Since your dev server is running, you need to:

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)
1. **Stop your dev server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running)
2. **Regenerate Prisma client:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Kill the Locked Process
If stopping the dev server doesn't work:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Find `node.exe` processes
3. End the ones related to your project
4. Run `npx prisma generate` again

## Verify the Fix

After regenerating Prisma client, test creating a cash booking:
1. Select CASH as payment method
2. Confirm and book
3. Should work now! ✅

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `PaymentMethod` enum
2. ✅ Database - Added 'CASH' to PaymentMethod enum  
3. ⏳ `node_modules/.prisma/client` - Needs regeneration (restart dev server)

## Quick Test

Once you've restarted the dev server, you can test by:
1. Creating a new booking
2. Selecting "CASH" as payment method
3. Should no longer get the 500 error

**Status:** Database is fixed ✅ | Prisma client needs regeneration (restart dev server)

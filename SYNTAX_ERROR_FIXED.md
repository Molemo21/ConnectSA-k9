# Syntax Error Fixed âœ…

## Problem
Build error in `components/dashboard/compact-booking-card.tsx`:
```
Error: Ã— Return statement is not allowed here
```

## Root Cause
There was duplicate code (lines 858-887) that was orphaned outside any function. This duplicate code included a `return` statement that was not inside a function context, causing the syntax error.

## Solution Applied
Removed the orphaned duplicate code (lines 858-887) that was attempting to redefine `isPaymentCompleted` and `steps` outside of the `getTimelineSteps` function.

## Files Modified
- âœ… `components/dashboard/compact-booking-card.tsx` - Removed duplicate orphaned code

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The file now compiles correctly with no syntax errors.

## Next Steps
1. Restart your dev server
2. Test the client dashboard
3. Should work now! ðŸŽ‰

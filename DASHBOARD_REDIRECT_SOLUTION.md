# Dashboard Redirect Solution for Draft Preservation

## 🎯 Problem Analysis

The issue was that after email verification, the auto-login flow was redirecting to `/book-service?resume=true`, but the booking page wasn't properly restoring the draft data. However, the dashboard's `DraftAwareBookingButton` was working correctly and showing "Resume Booking" when a draft existed.

## ✅ Solution: Redirect to Dashboard

**Decision**: Redirect to `/dashboard` instead of `/book-service` after email verification.

### Why This is Better:

1. **Proven to Work**: The dashboard already has working draft detection and "Resume Booking" functionality
2. **Better UX**: User sees their dashboard first, then can continue their booking with a clear "Resume Booking" button
3. **More Reliable**: Uses existing `DraftAwareBookingButton` logic that's already tested and working
4. **Clearer Intent**: User understands they're continuing a previous booking, not starting fresh

## 🔄 New User Flow

### Step 1: Draft Creation (Unchanged)
- User fills booking form (not logged in)
- Clicks "Sign up" in login modal
- Draft is saved to localStorage and server
- User is redirected to signup page

### Step 2: Email Verification (Updated)
- User receives verification email with `draftId` in URL
- Clicks verification link
- Email is verified successfully
- Auto-login occurs and draft is merged with user account
- **NEW**: User is redirected to `/dashboard` (not `/book-service`)

### Step 3: Dashboard Display (Existing Functionality)
- Dashboard loads and shows user's account
- `DraftAwareBookingButton` detects the pending draft
- Button displays "Resume Booking" instead of "New Booking"
- User clicks "Resume Booking" button

### Step 4: Draft Restoration (Existing Functionality)
- User is redirected to `/booking/resume?draftId=${draftId}`
- Booking page loads with draft data pre-filled
- User continues from where they left off

## 📝 Code Changes Made

### 1. Updated `app/verify-email/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Changed redirect destination
router.push('/dashboard') // Instead of '/book-service?resume=true'

// Updated UI text
"Redirecting to dashboard in {countdown} seconds..."
"🎉 Great! You're now logged in. You can continue your booking from the dashboard."
"Go to Dashboard (Skip Countdown)"
```

### 2. Updated `app/login/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Added support for dashboard intent
if (intent === "dashboard") {
  router.push("/dashboard")
}
```

### 3. Updated fallback redirects
```typescript
// Changed fallback login redirects to use dashboard intent
router.push(`/login?intent=dashboard&draftId=${pendingDraftId}`)
```

## 🎯 Expected Console Output (Updated)

### Step 1: Draft Creation (Unchanged)
```
📝 Draft saved to localStorage: [draft-id]
✅ Draft saved to server successfully
```

### Step 2: Email Verification (Updated)
```
📝 Found pending booking draft, auto-logging in and redirecting to continue booking: [draft-id]
✅ Auto-login successful: [user-email]
🔗 Attempting to merge draft [draft-id] with user [user-id]
✅ Successfully merged draft [draft-id] with user [user-id]
📝 Storing merged draft data for booking page: [draft-id]
📝 Stored in sessionStorage as resumeBookingData
```

### Step 3: Dashboard Display (New)
```
🔍 [Dashboard] Loading dashboard...
🔍 [DraftAwareBookingButton] Checking draft status...
🔍 [DraftAwareBookingButton] Found draft: [draft-id]
```

### Step 4: Resume Booking (Existing)
```
🔍 [BookService] Checking for resume booking data in sessionStorage...
🔍 [BookService] Found resume booking data, restoring form
📖 Resume data from sessionStorage: {"id":"[draft-id]",...}
🔍 [BookService] Form restored and resume data cleared
```

## 🧪 Testing the New Flow

### Test Steps:
1. **Fill booking form** (not logged in)
2. **Click "Sign up"** in login modal
3. **Complete signup** and verify email
4. **Check redirect** - should go to `/dashboard`
5. **Look for "Resume Booking" button** in dashboard
6. **Click "Resume Booking"** button
7. **Verify form is pre-filled** with previous data

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ User is redirected to dashboard after email verification
- ✅ Dashboard shows "Resume Booking" button instead of "New Booking"
- ✅ Clicking "Resume Booking" restores the form with previous data
- ✅ User can continue from where they left off

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

### Check Dashboard Draft Detection
```javascript
// In browser console on dashboard
const { checkDraftStatus } = await import('/lib/dashboard-draft-utils');
const status = await checkDraftStatus();
console.log('Draft status:', status);
```

### Check DraftAwareBookingButton
```javascript
// In browser console on dashboard
const button = document.querySelector('[data-testid="draft-aware-booking-button"]');
console.log('Button text:', button?.textContent);
```

### Check localStorage Draft
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Draft in localStorage:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('booking_draft')));
```

## 🎉 Benefits of This Solution

1. **Reliability**: Uses existing, tested functionality
2. **User Experience**: Clear visual indication of pending booking
3. **Maintainability**: Leverages existing `DraftAwareBookingButton` component
4. **Consistency**: Dashboard is the central hub for user actions
5. **Flexibility**: User can choose to continue booking or start new one

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the new flow** end-to-end
2. **Verify dashboard shows "Resume Booking"** button
3. **Confirm draft restoration works** when clicking the button
4. **Check fallback scenarios** (auto-login fails, manual login, etc.)

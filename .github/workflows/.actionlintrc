# Actionlint configuration for GitHub Actions workflows
# This file suppresses false positive warnings about secret context access

# These warnings are false positives - secrets.DATABASE_URL, secrets.DIRECT_URL, etc.
# are valid GitHub Actions contexts, but the linter can't verify they exist in the repo

# Ignore context access warnings for secrets (these are valid)
ignore:
  - 'Context access might be invalid.*secrets'
  - 'Unrecognized named-value.*secrets'

# Valid contexts that should not trigger warnings
valid-contexts:
  - secrets
  - env
  - github
  - needs
  - steps
  - vars

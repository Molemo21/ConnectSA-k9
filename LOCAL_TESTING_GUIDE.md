}
```

### When Clicking "Pay" (Cash):

```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Pay Now" button still appears
- **Check**: Is `paymentMethod` set to "CASH"?
- **Fix**: Verify the booking creation is setting paymentMethod correctly

### Issue: "Payment already exists" error
- **Check**: Has a payment record been created?
- **Fix**: The booking should have a payment record with status `CASH_PENDING`

### Issue: No cash payment status display
- **Check**: Is `paymentMethod` field being passed to components?
- **Fix**: Ensure the booking query includes `paymentMethod` field

### Issue: Provider can't confirm payment
- **Check**: API endpoint `/api/provider/cash-payment/confirm` exists
- **Fix**: Verify the endpoint is accessible and provider is authenticated

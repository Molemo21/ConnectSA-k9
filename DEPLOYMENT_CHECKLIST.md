## üîÑ Pending Steps

### 1. Database Migration
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection issue with production database
**Action Required**: Run the SQL script manually in your database

```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor or psql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "booking_drafts" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "serviceId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "date" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "time" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "address" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "notes" TEXT,
    "userId" TEXT,
    "expiresAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "booking_drafts_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "booking_drafts_userId_idx" ON "booking_drafts"("userId");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "booking_drafts_expiresAt_idx" ON "booking_drafts"("expiresAt");
```

### 2. Manual Testing
**Status**: ‚è≥ Ready to test
**Action Required**: Follow the manual test guide

1. **Test New User Signup Flow**:
   - Start booking ‚Üí Fill form ‚Üí Sign up ‚Üí Verify email ‚Üí Continue booking
   - Verify all data is preserved

2. **Test Existing User Login Flow**:
   - Start booking ‚Üí Fill form ‚Üí Sign in ‚Üí Continue booking
   - Verify all data is preserved

3. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Expired drafts
   - Network failures
   - Invalid draft IDs

### 3. Production Deployment
**Status**: ‚è≥ Ready to deploy
**Action Required**: Deploy code to production

1. **Code Deployment**:
   - Deploy updated files to production
   - Verify all endpoints are accessible
   - Test basic functionality

2. **Database Verification**:
   - Confirm `booking_drafts` table exists
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify indexes are created

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Monitor draft creation/retrieval rates
   - Track user flow completion rates
   - Set up error alerts

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
1. Go to `https://app.proliinkconnect.co.za/book-service`
2. Fill out the booking form
3. Try to continue (should prompt for login)
4. Sign up with a new email
5. Verify email
6. Check if booking data is preserved

### API Testing
Test these endpoints:
- `POST /api/bookings/drafts` - Create draft
- `GET /api/bookings/drafts/[id]` - Get draft
- `DELETE /api/bookings/drafts/[id]` - Delete draft
- `POST /api/bookings/drafts/[id]/merge` - Merge draft

### Browser Testing
Check browser console for:
- Draft creation logs
- Draft retrieval logs
- Error messages
- Network requests

## üîç Verification Points

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can start booking without being logged in
- [ ] Booking data is preserved during signup process
- [ ] Users can continue booking after email verification
- [ ] No data loss occurs at any step
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

### Monitoring Metrics
- Draft creation success rate
- Draft retrieval success rate
- User flow completion rate
- Error rates
- Response times

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. **Disable draft system**: Comment out draft saving in booking form
2. **Revert to sessionStorage**: Use existing sessionStorage fallback
3. **Database cleanup**: Remove `booking_drafts` table if needed
4. **Code rollback**: Revert to previous version

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Test with clean browser session
4. Check server logs
5. Review implementation documentation

## üìã Final Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Database table created
- [ ] All code deployed
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Error handling verified
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

## üéâ Success!

Once all steps are completed, users will be able to:
1. Start a booking without being logged in
2. Sign up for an account
3. Verify their email
4. Continue their booking seamlessly
5. Complete the booking without losing any progress

The booking draft preservation system will significantly improve user experience and reduce booking abandonment rates.
